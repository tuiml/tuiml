"""
TuiML - Modern machine learning toolkit inspired by WEKA.

A Python-based ML framework with a plugin architecture for extensibility.

Three levels of API:
    1. High-Level (Functional): tuiml.train() - One-liner with all parameters
    2. Mid-Level (Workflow): tuiml.Workflow() - Fluent chainable interface
    3. Low-Level (OOP): Direct class imports - Maximum control
